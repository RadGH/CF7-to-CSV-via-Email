# Contact Form 7 to CSV via Email

(Requires Advanced Custom Fields PRO)

Contact form submissions will be stored as a CSV file and emailed to a recipient of your choice. Every submission generates a CSV of all fields, and the email includes attachments. Will send to all forms by default, or you can specify which forms.
